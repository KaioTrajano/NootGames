# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Cloning the Repository

1- First, navigate to the directory that you would like to clone the repository into using commands like:
cd: to change your working directory.
cd ../ to "go back" a level in your directory tree.<br>

2- Next, clone the remote repository and create a local copy on your machine using this command:
git clone https://github.com/KaioTrajano/NootGames.git <br>

3- Now you can see the contents of the remote repository on your machine by moving into the newly cloned directory:
cd b575f19/
ls -la <br>

## Updating Your Local Repository
When changes are made to the remote repository, they will not automatically sync with your local copy. You can update your local directory by running the following command when your working directory is b575f19. You can check your working directory by running pwd, the last item in the path should be b575f19/.

To update your local git directory:
-git pull
